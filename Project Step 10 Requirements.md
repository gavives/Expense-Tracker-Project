Expense Tracker

1. As a user, I want to log in with a password and username to protect personal data

2. As an administrator, I want to be able to keep the users' data on a database so that if they ever need it or forget it, it is there

3. In order to get their information if they lost it or forgot it, they will be required to answer security questions that they answered when creating their account

19. The application will have a proper setup/installer after downloading the software

20. The program would be a pay to use program in order to ensure stability and overall structure of the program

Elliot, if you have made it this far, this is not all of the requirements that I would like to incorporate. This is what I have so far. These are a few that I could think of off the top of my head. In order to include more, I will need to sit down and draw out the overall design of my project and see it as I go in a way, since I am the overall designer of the program/software and I don't have any REAL requirements from an actual customer. 

Let me know what you think,
Gavin
