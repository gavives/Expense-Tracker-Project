1. Daily Expense Tracker
A system to keep track of expenses in a household enviornment or for personal use. The idea is simple yet logical and would increase savings, budgeting, etc. The system/application will keep a track of income-expense of a family or individual on a day to day basis. It would take monthly income and divide it into daily expense allowed. If you exceed that days expense it will cut if from your income and give a new daily expenses allowed amount, and if that days expense is less it will add it into your savings. At the end of the month, it will email you a report to show an income to expense amount to keep track of your budgeting and savings. 

-- Choosing to do a Daily Expense Tracker for my MSSA class project I have found will be challenging yet rewarding. The main concept I am trying to accomplish within my project is to eliminate financial distress on an individual or a family. Designing a program or application for this would be ideal for a single gentlemen in his early twenty's and also ideal for a fully developed family. Either way it is beneficial. Starting with writing the code for the program is only the beginning. Taking full advantage of the knowledge and skills I have learned this far in the MSSA program and making the smartest decisions within the code are key. Writing the best code for the program will ultimatley allow the program to run smoother. There will be bridges to cross and struggles throughout, but not giving up and being motivated to accomplish a task to help someone will be ultimatley rewarding. 

-- Implementing a database within T-SQL would keep things organized and running smooth as well. If the user uses the program for his or her family that includes husband, wife, and one to two middle age teenager(s) who have a job, all of their income and expenses would be able to be inputted into the database, keeping things organized. 

-- The program or application would be linked to the users bank account giving it access to monitor spending, bills, and other expenses. After tracking the user's bank activity, that data could be pushed to the database and organized into what is important and what is not, allowing the program to maximize the developement of the best spending habits and savings amounts. 

-- Ultimatley the program will be a challenge and I dont have it all together yet, but the more time I spend researching the idea and implementing the skills I have learned this far within the MSSA program, I feel as if I will have a fully developed and functional Daily Expense Tracker. Hopefully it developes as a well organized, well put together program to help someone out. The ultimate goal behind software developement and coding is to make a program better and if you provide the best program you possibly can, the user will be happy and that gives a tremendous amount of confidence to a beginner in the field.
