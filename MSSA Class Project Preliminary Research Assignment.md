1. Daily Expense Tracker
A system to keep track of expenses in a household enviornment or for personal use. The idea is simple yet logical and would increase savings, budgeting, etc. The system/application will keep a track of income-expense of a family or individual on a day to day basis. It would take monthly income and divide it into daily expense allowed. If you exceed that days expense it will cut if from your income and give a new daily expenses allowed amount, and if that days expense is less it will add it into your savings. At the end of the month, it will email you a report to show an income to expense amount to keep track of your budgeting and savings. 

2. Desktop Assistant
A program which gives a user of a computer someone to chat with, tell jokes to, and communicate with. The overall goal would be to have a voice activated assistant that would help with multitasking and quick problem solving as well as eliminate the high usage of computer memory and processing power with little to no GUI for the user.

3. Windows Media Platform
An audio/video platform to increase the speed, effectiveness, and overall interface for supporting various audio/video files. Providing pictures, samples, and links to information about the media as well as the actual song or video file. Also, links to interesting stories or news about the specific artist, director, etc. Programming/developing this piece of software/application would allow an all-in-one solution to everything related to music, movies, news, and media.
